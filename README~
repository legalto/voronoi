Files:

main.cpp - contains main loop for opencv window and user interface. Instantiates voronoi class
voronoi.h - class header file for voronoi class
voronoi.cu - contains function definitions for voronoi class as well as the CUDA kernels

Build Instructions:

I used Nsight to build this project so the makefile was auto generated. You should be able to import the project into Nsight by
importing this directory.

Dependencies:

C++11 - you will need to configure Nsight to build with C++11 enabled. On linux this means you need a gcc version of at least 4.9

OpenCV 2.4.9 or higher
	- I used 3.0, but any version should work since I only use it to display the image and draw sites
	- My project used shared libraries. I did not have access to the static libraries to link in 

Run:

To run the program you need to pass in an image.

./Voronoi -i ../images/crab.jpg

-i - option for image path
-n - option for number of sites, e.g. 3000 will start app with 3000 randomly generated sites
